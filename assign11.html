      In terms of computer graphics, we have seen extensive growth in its application from video games like Donkey Kong to CGI cinema to VR experiences. The possibilities of its usage are endless as we have seen its implementation in a myriad amount of industries. One sector of the many that interests me the most is Virtual Reality. While VR has managed to grow in popularity, I feel as thought it has more potential than the current VR games and interactive experiences that have been released. When I visited a friend who let me play a game on their VR headset, there were limited options of what was available—one was tied up sitting in a kitchen chair waiting for a zombie to enter the room, another was riding on a rollercoaster, and the final one was riding through an amusement park while knocking down clowns. Though I am not always up to date with what is being released in the VR world, from what I hear I feel as though the potential of the application is not being reached.

      In regard to user experience, what I appreciated the most about Sebastian’s lecture was the dedication to the user/player with the parallel object and container techniques. The innovations of allowing users to work together despite a difference of wanting to pick up and move a certain object or selecting a ‘container’ of objects together to move are extremely creative and ground breaking for multi-user experiences. His description of the ‘vibration feedback’ when a newly proposed location is set to the user’s view and their ‘teleportation’ to a new view allows for the easy collaboration of others and is something I believe is cutting edge and innovational. These interactive ideas can span into many more ideas rather than simply a prototype city game and open up creativity amongst different sectors of VR.

     With the discussion of the Cave and The Tempest pieces from this week, I realized how accessible VR can make entertainment and experiences. The potential for VR is limitless—as Sebastian mentioned, a VR experience can be much more than just a game or short videos. VR presents the opportunity for learning, bringing a group together for something great, or teaching about something new. VR could be for entertainment, such as a movie or story being told or even a recreation of a sports game to watch from different angels, for education such as a journey amongst solar systems and planets, or for research, like presenting students with VR skeletal systems or bodies. What I am excited to see are the educational uses of the platform, I feel as though a museum VR experience would be something that many would be interested in, or even incorporating it into the classroom. While some may argue that our world would heavily rely on technology if VR would seep into everyday life, I feel that such a platform can only be used for good.
